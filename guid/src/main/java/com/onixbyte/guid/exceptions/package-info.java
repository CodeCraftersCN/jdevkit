/**
 * This package contains the custom exception classes related to GUID generation. These exceptions
 * are thrown when there are issues or errors during the generation or processing of global unique
 * identifiers (GUIDs).
 * <p>
 * The main exception class in this package is {@link com.onixbyte.guid.exceptions.TimingException},
 * which is a runtime exception and serves as the base exception for all other custom exceptions
 * related to GUID generation.
 * <p>
 * Custom exceptions in this package provide specific information about the type of error that
 * occurred during GUID generation, making it easier for developers to handle and respond to
 * different scenarios when dealing with GUIDs. They are designed to enhance the robustness and
 * reliability of the GUID generation process by providing clear and meaningful error messages to
 * the developers.
 * <p>
 * Developers using the GUID generation module should be aware of the possible exceptions that can
 * be thrown and handle them appropriately to ensure smooth operation and error handling in
 * their applications.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
