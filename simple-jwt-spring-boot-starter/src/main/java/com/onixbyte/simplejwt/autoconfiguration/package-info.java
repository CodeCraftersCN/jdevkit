/**
 * <p>
 * The classes in this package are responsible for automatically configuring
 * the Simple JWT library when it is used in a Spring Boot application. They
 * provide default settings and configurations to ensure that the library works
 * smoothly and seamlessly without requiring developers to manually configure
 * it.
 * 
 *
 * <p>
 * Developers using the Simple JWT library with Spring Boot do not need to
 * explicitly configure the library, as the auto-configuration classes take
 * care of setting up the necessary components and configurations
 * automatically. However, developers still have the flexibility to customize
 * the behavior of the library by providing their own configurations and
 * properties.
